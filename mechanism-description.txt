Assignment 4 - Mechanism Description
------------

Sharding
--
We made an important hash algo to determine where a key gets sent to by using the shard count to uniformly distribute the keys
We used a global array to keep track of the members of each shard
If a request is made to the incorrect shard, it is forwarded to the correct one

Resharding
--
Determine if requested shard count is valid (checking nodes on view and check possible length)
If valid, we try to redistiubte the nodes amoung the shards (by broadcasting to the first node in each shard)
Then we detmine if a key belongs in the new shard: if it doent we send a PUT to the correct shard and delete it locally

Adding new members
--
The first node that recives the request adds to its own view then broadcasts to other nodes
with other information about whether it came form a client or a node, the global shards, and the shard count
